1. DATA:

Due to the extraordinary amount of data, there is no way to submit on mycourses, however
I have uploaded all the necessary files that are required to run the program on google drive:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qbnuRwr9PjzqLGa0ke2cORgLT8qbqpsO

Please copy data and unfiltered_data folders to the same directory as the script files.
ex: 
project/hive_method.py
project/data/hive_X.pkl
project/unfiltered_data/bitcoin_1.pkl
	

2. CODE:

To get the output of results.txt:
$ python3 baseline_classifiers.py

Testing:
The code can be rerun on any set of prepared data from both direct or hive method. This data can be generated by the following commands args:

$ python3 hive_method.py <chunk_start> <chunk_end>
or 
$ python3 direct_method.py <chunk_start> <chunk_end>

where chunk_start and _end are the indices of the bitcoin unfiltered_data files

then sent to baseline classifiers as follows:

$ python3 baseline_classifiers <method>
where <method> = 'direct' or 'hive'

Please note, that the file was prepared specifically to be run without any arguments, so with 
additional arguments, the print statements will not correspond with the output.
In the main method,
change the filepath to whichever file you wish to text in the pickle command

for analysis with text, set X = vectorize_text(X, method)
for analysis without, set X = remove_text(X_method)

Then perform regression or classification with the proper params. Note, larger sets will certainly experience memory issues and take a long time to run.
